# HTTRACK
What is HTTrack? It is a useful application which allows you to download any publically accessable website, including ones locked behind logins or other authentication methods. It has dozens of features such as: get HTML files first, external depth, internal depth and more! It is quick and easy to use, and you can also download multiple websites at the same time.

So what is this repository for and about then? Well in the event that HTTrack is discontinued, or that it breaks / development ends, we will have a huge repository of over 900 of its archived releases ready to deploy and use. Additionally, we will have a large amount of its documentation scraped, as well as repositories and other important notes. Once we have fully completed this archiving project, we will make sure to post it all on the repository wiki.
